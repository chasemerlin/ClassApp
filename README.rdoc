I upgraded to Rails 4 (Ruby, Git, Heroku, and Rails 3.2 were already set up), started a new project, configured to use pg in production and sqlite in development by using groupings inside the gemfile, and added a home page called 'home' under 'PagesController' as the root path in routes that simply says 'William Merlin's Home Page'. I did not encounter any additional installation or configuration issues, as all components other than Rails 4 had already been installed prior to the course.
